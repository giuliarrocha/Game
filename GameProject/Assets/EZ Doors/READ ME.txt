NOTE: Install Text Mesh Pro from Package Manager if not already installed.

1. Create Empy GameObject
2. Reset GO position to world origin (0,0,0)
3. Set GO y-position to half the height of the intended door
	EXAMPLE: If the door height is 3, set y-position to 1.5
4. Add Rotating / Sliding Door component
5. Size Box Collider to size of the door, equal to the door mesh dimensions and center to door mesh
6. Add door mesh as child or create your own door mesh (no collider is needed on mesh)
